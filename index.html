            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I

            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
            amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
            were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
            example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a
            job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
            recommend! "
